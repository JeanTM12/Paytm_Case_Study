## Origin & Overview
Paytm a One97 venture was found in August 2010 with an initial investment of $2 million by its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma in Noida, a region adjacent to India's capital New Delhi. Paytm started by offering mobile recharge and utility bill payments and today it offers a full marketplace to consumers on its mobile apps. Paytm in the most simplified terms is nothing but a medium through which anybody & everybody can recharge or pay majorly all their bills.

While India’s telecom infrastructure was improving in 2010, Vijay’s investors were not confident about the idea of a mobile-first consumer service that would cater to the masses. He personally put $2 Mn at stake to finally launch the brand. The whole idea was to bring in an innovation on the way mobile recharge could be done in India.
Paytm has a strong foundation with regards to funding-the who’s who of the investment world is backing it, including Japan’s Softbank ($1.4 billion), China’s Ant Financial (Alipay) and Alibaba Group ($700 Million), SAIF Partners ($8.3 million), and Berkshire Hathaway ($357 million).
