## Origin & Overview
Paytm a One97 venture was found in August 2010 with an initial investment of $2 million by its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma in Noida, a region adjacent to India's capital New Delhi. Paytm started by offering mobile recharge and utility bill payments and today it offers a full marketplace to consumers on its mobile apps. Paytm in the most simplified terms is nothing but a medium through which anybody & everybody can recharge or pay majorly all their bills.

While India’s telecom infrastructure was improving in 2010, Vijay’s investors were not confident about the idea of a mobile-first consumer service that would cater to the masses. He personally put $2 Mn at stake to finally launch the brand. The whole idea was to bring in an innovation on the way mobile recharge could be done in India.
Paytm has a strong foundation with regards to funding-the who’s who of the investment world is backing it, including Japan’s Softbank ($1.4 billion), China’s Ant Financial (Alipay) and Alibaba Group ($700 Million), SAIF Partners ($8.3 million), and Berkshire Hathaway ($357 million).

## Business Activities:
**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

When the company was founded, most of India's population had no access to formal banking services at all. Those that did have bank accounts often struggled to use the instruments available to them. Less than 2 percent of the population had a credit account. Cash and cheques were the norm.

Paytm's core business has always revolved around payments. But the company sees itself more as a 'problem solver' than a bank or a tech firm. The first pain point the company solved for India's consumers was around pre-paid mobile top-ups: Paytm allowed customers to top their accounts up instantly on their phones rather than going to a store, buying a top-up card and struggling with an extraordinarily long password. That allowed it to build brand awareness and a loyal customer base. n 2014, the company introduced the Paytm Wallet. “Allowing customers to store money in their virtual wallet meant that Indian consumers could now make transactions using digital money,” noted Harinder Takhar, former CEO of Paytm in India and current CEO of Paytm Labs Inc. Toronto, Canada.. “It was a game changer.”
“The Goal of Paytm is to bring half a billion unbanked Indian consumers into the formal banking system.”

In the year 2015 Reserve Bank of India granted it a license to start first payment bank in India. The intention of the bank is to use existing user-base of Paytm to offer diversified new services like online transfer, savings account, online banking and debit cards. Paytm has become easy-to-use and innovative interface and this has been possible because of its features as well as its pricing policy. The company was the first to start a trend of cashback and instead of discounts they offered a money back in wallets.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Users of Paytm's app have access to a stunning array of goods and services. At last count, the platform boasted more than 15 million merchants across more than 200 different categories of service. Having been one of the first to get into the online billing market, they have a much bigger customer base than any of their competitor in India. 

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?**

The unfair advantage that Paytm has is “First mover Advantage”, Paytm was the first online payment company to set up operations in India. Their timing was perfect since they started operations at around the same time when smartphones started becoming popular. Also they have been able to grab and hold the attention of customers primarily because of the never-ending offer stream it has been announcing, these are custom designed with the Indian mindset in the frame and thus works like magic for zooming sales.

Paytm can be used to transact with more than 3 million merchants across India and the number is said to be growing every day. This makes Paytm an easy shopping option for most customers irrespective of their economic background or education.

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**


To make the most of app analytics that capture user behavior, Paytm’s data science lab, Paytm Labs, in Toronto, Canada, works on developing multiple software tools. One such key tool is CLM or Customer Lifecycle Management.
According to Deepak Abbot, senior vice president of the company who is based at Paytm’s headquarters at Noida near Delhi, what CLM does is “catch every ‘signal’ from the app”. Explaining how it works, he said, “If you use the app for UPI, it segments you as a UPI user; if you do a recharge, it marks you as a recharge user. It also upgrades you automatically based on your behavior or purchase history. So, for instance, if you make an electricity bill payment or a post-paid bill payment, it upgrades you to a post-paid user.” There is a lot of granularity built into the CLM tool to classify and reward different levels of users at different times.

## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Payments & Remittance

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
In the last 65 years of development in these technologies is that while they became mainstream and widely used by banks and their customers, the banking sector was not threatened. On the contrary, banks grew. In looking at the U.S.’s FDIC data, from 1950 to 2014, the number of bank branches in the country grew from approximately 18,000 to over 82,000. But now in the early part of the 21st century, retail financial services are being further digitized via mobile wallets, payment apps, robo-advisors for wealth and retirement planning, equity crowdfunding platforms for access to private and alternative investment opportunities and online lending platforms.  These fintech services are not simple enhancements to banking services, but rather replacing banking services completely. 
In most developed countries, the majority of households have at least one bank account which they use as their central hub for receiving paychecks, making payments and saving money.
But this isn’t the case everywhere. In under-banked or un-banked regions, primarily in parts of Asia and Africa, many individuals hold their life savings in cash, without bank accounts. To capture this distinction more broadly, in developing countries, banking penetration is approximately 41%, compared to 89% in developed countries. In India for example, the country has approximately 102,000 bank branches for a population that is roughly four times that of the U.S., which has approximately 82,000 bank branches.
Fintech startups that offer secure mobile wallets and payment apps are allowing these unbanked populations to safely store their money and make purchases without having to worry about storing or carrying large amounts of cash. M-Pesa (Africa) and Paytm (India) is probably the most successful example of such an app
